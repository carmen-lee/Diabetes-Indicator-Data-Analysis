# CS422ML-Diabetetes-Model

Diabetes is a disease that affects over 400 million people worldwide. It is characterized by the inability of your body to produce or utilize the hormone insulin to break down glucose. In other words, it affects how your body turns food into energy. Despite how commonplace the condition is and the amount of resources available, it frequently goes undiagnosed for years. 
The goal of this project is to accurately detect diabetes in an individual by applying and comparing the performance of various commonly used machine learning algorithms.
